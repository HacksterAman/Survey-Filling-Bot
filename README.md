# SRM University Feedback Form Filling Bot

## Overview

Are you a inocent student trapped in the hell on earth known as SRM University? Fear not! This Python bot is your ticket to freedom from the soul-sucking feedback forms that seem to multiply faster than course credits.

## Prerequisites

To embark on this liberating journey, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (https://www.python.org/)
- PyAutoGUI library (install using `pip install pyautogui`)
- A sense of humor (non-negotiable)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository because why not add another repository to the endless list of things complicating your life?

```bash
https://github.com/HacksterAman/Survey-Filling-Bot
```

2. Drop those image files ("Select.png" and "Average.png") into the same directory. Yes, it's that simple.

3. Execute the Python script and watch as the bot conquers the feedback form, setting you free from the shackles of academic bureaucracy.

```bash
python freedom_bot.py
```

4. Ensure the feedback form window is visible; after all, we wouldn't want to miss the chance to break free.

5. Kick back, relax, and savor the sweet taste of rebellion as the bot navigates through the maze of meaningless questions.

## Customization

Feel the need to express your frustration in a more creative way? Customize the script to reflect your inner rebel.

For example, if you want the bot to scream "Boring" instead of "Average," edit these lines:

```python
# Customize the image file to match your desired expression of discontent
average = pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen("Boring.png", confidence=.9)
```

Make sure to have the corresponding image file ("Boring.png") in the script's directory. Because, let's face it, who wouldn't find endless feedback forms boring?

## Disclaimer

This bot is your ally, not a substitute for genuine academic engagement (unfortunately). Use it with caution and maintain a sense of humor. Remember, education is a journey, and sometimes you need a rebellious sidekick to make it more bearable.

## Contribute and Improve

I believe in the power of collaboration and humor. If you have jokes, improvements, or suggestions to make this bot even more legendary, don't hesitate to contribute. Open a pull request, share your brilliance, and let's turn this escape bot into a masterpiece!
